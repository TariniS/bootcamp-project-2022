            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Combine together the water, sugar and yeast</li>
              <li>Let sit for 5-10 minutes</li>
              <li>Add in milk, yogurt, oil, garlic, baking powder, salt</li>
              <li>Mix until dough comes together</li>
              <li>Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Use floured hands to knead the dough until smooth, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
              <li>Lightly grease the same mixing bowl with a small spray of cooking oil. Transfer dough to the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for about an hour until doubled in size</li>
              <li>When ready to cook, divide the dough into 10 equal pieces. Roll into balls, then use a rolling pin to roll each piece of dough into a large oval, about 6-inches long and 1/8-inch thick. Repeat with remaining dough</li>
              <li>Heat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Grease skillet all over with 1/2 teaspoon of the extra oil</li>
              <li>Place one piece of the naan on the oiled hot skillet and cook until bubbles form on top, about 1-2 minutes. While cooking, brush the top with a little oil</li>
              <li>Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes, until large golden spots appear on the bottom</li>
              <li>Remove from the skillet and wrap in a clean kitchen towel. Repeat with the remaining naan (keep them wrapped in a towel while you work</li>

              <li>Enjoy!</li>
